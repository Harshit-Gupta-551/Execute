The first step would be to create a software program that can instantly measure the user's bodily size and shape. 
This can be accomplished by using a 3D scanner or computer vision methods like image and depth sensors.

Next, to enable the user to see themselves wearing the clothing item in real-time, the software would need to integrate cutting-edge AR or VR technology. 
This can be done by using marker-based or markerless AR or by using VR technology to create a virtual world that the user can immerse themselves in.


The user interface should be made to be simple to use and straightforward. 
The user should be able to choose the clothing item they want to put on.
